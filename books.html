                        Reading is one of my favorite passtimes and I have been doing it since I was a little kid.
                        I read whatever I can get my hands on whenver I can get my hands on it.
                        Books are the greatest way to develop one's mind and to learn a lot and I have first hand experience on that matter.<br><br>
                        With that said, I am not to keen to disclose that I don't have a copy of the many books I have read that I think are absolutely wonderful.
                        Below are some of the books that I have read that I enjoyed and would recommend to anyone.
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Ninteen Eighty Four(1984)</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    A book published in 1949 whose predictions about the future are becoming more real everyday, now it can't get better than that.
                                    This bleakly dystopian novel written by George Orwell about the dangers of totalitariansim warns against a world where governed by propoganda, surveillance and censorship.<br>
                                    The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, 
                                    and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute 
                                    individuality and independent thinking.Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not exist. The protagonist, 
                                    Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. I would recommend this to anyone who seeks
                                    to break free from opression.<br><br>

                            <dt>The Great Gatsby</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    The story is of a fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his new love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Told from the prespective of Nick Carraway who moves to New York after World War I
                                    to pursue a career in bonds. He recounts the events of the summer he spent two years later. The style of the book is wry, sophisticated and elegiac, employing extended metaphors.
                                    This is considered one of the greatest American Novels and after reading it, one can easily understand why.<br><br>

                            <dt>Great Expectations</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Great Expectations is the story of Pip, an orpahn boy adopted by a blacksmith's family, who has good luck and great expectations, and then loses both his luck and his expectations.
                                    Through the rise and fall, however, Pip learns how to find happiness. He learns the meaning of friendship and the meaning of love and, of course, becomes a better person for it.
                                    This was the peniltimate novel by Charles Dickens and it recceived universal acclaim upon its release. It is still considered as one of the greatest novels ever written.
